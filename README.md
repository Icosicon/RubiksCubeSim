##Getting Started

Here's how to get started with the Icosicon Rubik's Cube Simulator

###Download
Download an installer for the [latest version](https://github.com/Icosicon/RubiksCubeSim/releases/latest) of RBSim;
Choose either an executable installer or a zipped folder (either x86 or x64 depending on your system)

###Installing Using Zipped Folder
1. Locate the downloaded zipped folder
2. Extract the files to wherever's convenient (we recommend `C:/Program Files`)\*
3. Run **`Rubik's Cube Sim.exe`** to boot up the program
4. If you want to, create a shortcut to **`Rubik's Cube Sim.exe`** on your **desktop** (`C:\Users\user\Desktop\`) and/or **start menu** (`C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\`)

\**RBSim can be used as a portable application provided the architecture (x86/x64) is correct for the system in use*

###Installing Using Installer
1. Locate the downloaded installer application
2. Run the installer application and grant necessary permissions
3. Follow the installer application through various steps to install RBSim
  * Customization of shortcuts and output folders is available
4. If you chose to add a start menu (off by default) or desktop shortcut (off by default) use these to run the main executable
5. If not, navigate to the folder in which you chose to install the program, and run **`Rubik's Cube Sim.exe`** to boot up RBSim
